# AstroBenchHack
AstroHackWeek2020 Hack proposal about astro benchmark datasets


### Title
Astro-MNIST

### Hack Creator
Aleksandra Ciprijanovic

### Why?
* Currently there are no official benchmarking datasets in astronomy (astro-MNIST) that can be used to compare different ML models and techniques in order to understand the improvements and benefits of novel ML approaches.
* It is becoming increasingly hard to compare results to previous ML studies by other groups and authors. Not everyone uploads their dataset/code/detailed instructions to reproduce the published results. 
* Plan - starting to work on resources that will summ up different available (or we could create new) datasets for various astronomical research fields (galaxy images, superova spectra etc.). Also have links to different simple simulation tools that exist, which we can use to create simulated benchmarking datasets. Plus a document summing up astro best practices for pubishing research that involves new ML techniques.

### What do we need?
* Combined knolwedge from astro comunity and researchers from different fields, so we can brainstorm about all the things we need to include.
* We can perhaps use data we allredy used n our research or we know about?
* No computing resources needed.

### How?
* Steps: 
- Make a github repo that will be home of the project.
- Add links to simulations that can be used for benchmarking, plus witre a nice document explaining all available resources.
- Decide which areas and datasets we want to start with. Are they already available somewhere...if yes add links.
- If a dataset is not available somewhere brainstorm what would be the best way to store and make these datasets available.
- Write a "Best practices how to guide".
* All of the steps can be worked on simultaiously in a group or individualy. We'll need to discuss a lot of things over coffee and add things to github.

### Who?
* No minimum knowledge required. Combined knowledge by astrophysiscis and data scientists from other fields will be crucial here.
* Even people with no computing skills can help.
* Experience in ML in astronomy or other fields is important in the sense that these people will be aware of the problems we have in astronomy related to benchmarking models and reproducibility of astro-ML results.
