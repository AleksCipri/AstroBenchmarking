### ABOUT THE PROJECT
* Currently there are no official benchmarking datasets in astronomy (astro-MNIST) that can be used by the community to compare different ML models and techniques in order to understand the improvements and benefits of novel approaches.
* It is becoming increasingly hard to compare results to previous ML studies by other groups and authors. Not everyone uploads their dataset/code/detailed instructions to reproduce the published results. 
* Goal of the project - gather resources in one spot - links to available simulators (for dataset generation) and simualted / observed datasets; links to hosted datasets we prepared for various astronomical research fields (galaxy images, variable stars, superova spectra etc.). Produce example jupyter files for using datasets to facilitate easier use and learning.

### ASTRONOMY + ML BEST PRACTICES



### AVAILABLE RESOURCES




### SIMULATIONS 




### SIMULATED DATASETS



### REAL DATASETS



### WANT TO CONTRIBUTE?
* We need combined knolwedge from the entire astro comunity and researchers from different fields! Are you working in ML? Do you have a sutable dataset that can be used for benchmaring? Do you have experience in coding, open-source software? Please reach out if you want to help!
